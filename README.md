A modified version of chimera which restores a few features how they were intended to get seen.

	• Reverted interpolation
	• Reverted camera fixes
	• Reverted contrail fixes
	• Reverted Gamma lock
	• Restored 1103 waves

This project will evolve over time to as chimera does and will eventually lock the framerate to 
avoid confusion altogether as a seperate unique version for an intended purpose exclusively.

NOTE GAMMA LOCK AFFECTS THE OS AND REQUIRES RESTART TO RESET VALUES TO DEFAULT
 
What it does over the regular chimera version to maintain consistency with the 2003 version.
 
	1102 mipmap ripples intensity at high resolution on the horizon waves while scoping.
	Forces interpolation off intended for stronger framebuffer effects locked 30 framerate.
	Reverts any enhancers associated with those unused, restoring regular PC functionality.
